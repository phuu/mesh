This is the document I created in the half hour before I started building.

## 90 min: Understand Fast

### Ideas

* 5 second app usage: "What do you remember?"
* **Diagram sharing. No words, only diagrams**
* Quick language translation

### Iteration

* Add links/images to diagrams that explain something well
* Draw diagrams online
* Helper site about drawing understandable diagrams
* **Drop-in solution/library for diagramming in html/css/js**

### Features

* HTML, CSS and Javascript library for creating accessible diagrams
* Flowcharts, arrows, boxes, text
* Must be text version translated

### Minimum

* Text flow turned into HTML & CSS diagram via JS
* Online proof-of-concept

### Plan

* Create HTML sketch of a flow chart
    * Classes to indicate roles (or aria roles?)
    * Text used so that it reads properly
    * Text hidden when diagrammed
* Create CSS to convert it to something that looks like a diagram
    * Arrow shape – SVG, CSS, image…
* Create page that demos the system

### Try again

* Interactive diagramming (like Bret Victor's Tangle)
* Highly portable and accessible
* Drop in JS solution
* For understanding relationships between data fast
* Should work anywhere, even inside other elements

### Minimum

* Control interactions between elements using mouse
* Drop in solution to any page
`data-mesh-source`, `data-mesh-target="x * x"`
